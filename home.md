<h1 style="text-align: center;">WATER WITHOUT BORDERS</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Exploring the links between Hydrology and Hydrogeology</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">21/07/2025 - 23/07/2025</h3>

Welcome to the 20th HYDrological MODeling Workshop (AG HydMod)! 

At this workshop, we bring together early-career scientists with a water-related background and create a space to connect, exchange ideas, and explore new perspectives. This year, our aim is to cross the boundaries between hydrology and hydrogeology by tackling critical interfaces such as climate change, extreme events, and pollution.

We're excited to offer you a diverse scientific and networking programme. The workshop will feature keynote talks by leading experts from academia and industry, interactive discussions on interdisciplinary challenges, a poster session, and an excursion to Berlin. Beyond the science, we emphasize networking and career development: The GFZ Career Center will provide valuable guidance, and our keynote speakers will share personal career journeys. To foster connections, we will engage in group work, share meals, and enjoy informal networking opportunities between the scientific activities and in the evenings.

The workshop is an annual event organized by the AG HYDMOD (Deutsche Hydrologische Gesellschaft). We are thrilled to host it at the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences on the historic Telegrafenberg in Potsdam. Join us for an engaging, interdisciplinary exchange - we look forward to welcoming you!
