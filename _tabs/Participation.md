### What you can expect

Compared to tightly scheduled scientific conferences, the workshop has its main emphasis on active discussion and exchange between the participants. We encourage participants not only to question or defend their methods, but also to think about new ideas and perspectives related to their work.

To get into this discussion, we will organize poster sessions. Therefore, we ask you to bring a poster to the workshop, where you can pitch your research to the other participants and have a lively discussion. We encourage you to also present your work-in-progress and potential challenges you are facing.

The official workshop language is English.
